# Voltage API

Use **Voltage API** in developer contexts and **Voltage** for the product. Older
sources and dashboard labels may say “Payments”; keep exact API identifiers and
UI labels when needed to locate something.

## Establish the contract

1. Use the bundled [OpenAPI contract](references/openapi.json), including its
   embedded guides, as the authority. Its provenance is in
   [sources.json](references/sources.json).
2. Use [Voltage docs](https://docs.voltageapi.com/) for product/setup context only
   where consistent with the contract. Consult
   [known discrepancies](references/known-discrepancies.md) before adapting examples.
3. Do not use older Voltage APIs, third-party snippets, or model memory to invent
   missing endpoints or behavior. When asked for current information, verify the
   live [contract](https://voltageapi.com/v1/openapi/docs.json) and affected docs;
   disclose unavailable verification. Do not silently rewrite the installed snapshot.
4. If the contract itself documents a gap, expose the limitation. In particular,
   do not fabricate a canonical Taproot Asset send request.

## Read only what the task needs

| Task | Reference |
|---|---|
| Understand terminology, funding models, setup, or applicability | [Product model](references/product-model.md) |
| Obtain IDs, configure credentials, execute curl, or switch environment | [Configuration and execution](references/configuration.md) |
| Find any endpoint, auth requirement, payload, filter, or response | [API index](references/api-index.md), then inspect the exact operation |
| Send, receive, poll, handle errors, inspect balances | [Payment lifecycle](references/payment-lifecycle.md) |
| USD conversion, processing fees, treasury, swaps | [Specialized flows](references/specialized-flows.md) |
| Verify callbacks, manage deliveries, reconcile payments | [Webhooks](references/webhooks.md) |
| Integrate hosted checkout or browser session/stream APIs | [Checkout](references/checkout.md) |

Resolve scripts and references relative to **this installed skill directory**, not
the user's project. In the commands below, `<skill-dir>` means that directory:

```sh
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/inspect-operation.py create_payment --part request
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/inspect-operation.py get_payment --part response
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/inspect-operation.py --schema Amount
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/inspect-operation.py --guide Payments --section 'Workflow: pay a known BTC invoice from a USD wallet'
```

The inspector includes referenced schema definitions and operation-specific
security schemes. Read both constraints and descriptions: runtime prerequisites
are not all expressible in JSON Schema. The unmodified source guides may contain
upstream relative links; those are not local skill files.

## Integrate or execute

- Establish organization, environment, wallet, network, currency, and the intended
  action. Reuse configured values and prior user authorization. Ask only for missing
  details that affect correctness or authorization. Do not pick a wallet arbitrarily.
- For ordinary account access use an environment key in `x-api-key`. Check each
  operation's security contract; checkout browser tokens are different credentials.
- Generate and persist UUIDv4 IDs before submitting payments. Empty `202` means
  accepted, not paid. Use bounded reads to wait for the needed state; reconcile
  ambiguous writes by the existing ID rather than blindly retrying or creating a new ID.
- Use integer base units: BTC millisatoshis, USD cents, assets their base units.
  For generated JavaScript, reject values outside the safe-integer range or use a
  lossless JSON strategy; the API's int64 range exceeds JavaScript's safe integers.
- Direct requests are supported through the [curl helper](scripts/request.py).
  Read configuration guidance first. It performs one request with no automatic retry,
  and supports the environment-API-key operations, not checkout browser transport.
- A balance check authorizes reads; an invoice request authorizes that receive;
  a send requires an authorized destination, amount, wallet, and understood fees.
  Resolve consequential ambiguity before execution. Do not require repeat approval
  for actions already authorized. A connectivity check alone does not authorize spending.
- Before test payments, verify the wallet's network and environment. A label such
  as “staging” does not prove test funds. Do not silently fall back to mainnet.
- Keep secrets server-side and out of chat, logs, version control, and browser code.
  Webhook creation/rotation returns a one-time secret: arrange secure output before
  executing it. Preserve customer defaults when using one-off configuration overrides.

For application code, adapt [voltage-client.ts](assets/voltage-client.ts) for
bounded payment polling and [verify-webhook.ts](assets/verify-webhook.ts) for raw-body
signature verification. These are focused examples, not a full SDK. Inspect the
operation and response schemas when extending them.

Report the HTTP outcome separately from the business outcome, include relevant
non-secret resource IDs, and state whether a payment completed, failed, is still
pending, or has an uncertain submission outcome. Never label an invoice as paid
because it was generated or a webhook delivery succeeded.
